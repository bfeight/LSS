I have always enjoyed sports and have gotten into Fantasy Sports, mostly NBA and NFL, over the past five years.
When you play fantasy sports it can be very benefical to get the most up to date information right when it comes out. 
There are a number of sites that you constantly have to check to make sure you did not miss any breaking news. 
The point of LastStopSport is to make ONE site you can visit to get the most up to date information from the most 
credible sources. 

I used a TwitterAPI to get the latest tweets from the best sources in sports. I also scrape the teams that play each night
along with the lines.
